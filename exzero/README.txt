Start here to solve the exzero task.

In this task, you will implement a function to count the number of
zeros in an array of integers.

Details: Modify and complete the file exzero.c by implementing the
function count_zeros(). The count_zeros() function takes two
arguments: an array of signed int and the length of the array which is
also a signed int. The return value is of type signed int and is the
number of zeros in the array. If the array is NULL or the length
parameter is less than zero, count_zeros() returns -1.

Your solution should reside entirely in exzero.c. You may not
introduce additional files. Only the count_zeros() function will be
graded, but your exzero.c file should compile and run. A main()
function is provided and may be modified to aid in testing.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
======================
You may not add new source files, you must change only exzero.c.
