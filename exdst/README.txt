Start here to solve the exdst task.

In this task, you will implement a function to calculate the distance
between two points expessed in integer coordinates x1,y1 x2,y2.

Details: Modify and complete the file exdst.c by implementing the
function dst(). The dst() function takes 4 parameters of type signed
int: x1, y1, x2 and y2, which are the coordinates of 2 points.  The
value returned is of type double. The return value is the Euclidean
distance between the points, calculated using double-precision
floating point numbers.

Your solution should reside entirely in exdst.c. You may not  
introduce additional files. Only the dst() function will be graded, 
but your exdst.c file should compile and run. A main() function is  
provided and may be modified to aid in testing.

======================
You may not add new source files, you must change only
exdst.c.
