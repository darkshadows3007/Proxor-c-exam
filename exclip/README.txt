Start here to solve the exclip task.

In this task, you will implement a function to limit a value to fall
within a given range.

Details: Modify and complete the file exclip.c by implementing the
function clip(). The clip() function takes three arguments of type 
signed int: the value (to be clipped), the minumum, and the maximum. 
The function return value is the minimum if the value is lower than 
minimum, maximum if the value is greater than maximum, and otherwise 
is the value. Assume that maximum is greater than or equal to
minimum.

Your solution should reside entirely in exclip.c. You may not 
introduce additional files. Only the clip() function will be graded,
but your exclip.c file should compile and run. A main() function is 
provided and may be modified to aid in testing.

===============================

% make        -- Compile your program
% make run    -- Run your program
% make debug  -- debug your program
% make submit -- submit your program


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ====================== 
You may not add new source files, you must change only exclip.c.
