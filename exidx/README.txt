Start here to solve the exidx task.

In this task, you will implement a function to find the index of 
a character value in a one dimensional array of characters.


Details: Modify and complete the file exidx.c by implementing the
function find_idx(). The find_idx() function takes 3 arguments: the
character (of type char) to search for, an array of characters (of
type char) to search, and the size of the array (of type int). The
function should return the index of the first occurrence of character
in the array. If the array does not contain the character, return -1.

Your solution should reside entirely in exidx.c. You may not  
introduce additional files. Only the find_idx() function will be
graded, but your exidx.c file should compile and run. A main()
function is provided and may be modified to aid in testing.

% make        -- Compile your program
% make run    -- Run your program
% make debug  -- debug your program
% make submit -- submit your program


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
======================
You may not add new source files, you must change only exidx.c.
